### Troubleshooting Common Usage Issues

#### API Rate Limits
**Problem**: "Rate limit exceeded" error
**Solution**: 
- Reduce batch size (try 10-15 CVs instead of 50)
- Wait 1-2 minutes between large batches
- Switch to Groq API if using OpenAI (often has higher limits)

#### Empty or Incomplete CVs
**Problem**: Generated CVs are too short or missing sections
**Solution**:
- Try different experience levels (High often generates more content)
- Switch between Groq and OpenAI versions
- Regenerate the batch (AI output can vary)

#### Download Issues
**Problem**: ZIP file won't download or is corrupted
**Solution**:
- Ensure all CVs finished generating before downloading
- Try refreshing the page and regenerating
- Check browser download settings and permissions

### Best Practices for Different Use Cases

#### HR and Recruitment
- Use realistic locations for your target market
- Generate 15-25 CVs per role for good variety
- Mix experience levels to see different candidate profiles
- Test with roles similar to your actual openings

#### System Testing and Development
- Start with small batches (5-10 CVs) for initial testing
- Use "Random" experience level for diverse test data
- Generate CVs for multiple roles to test system compatibility
- Verify PDF parsing and data extraction with generated files

#### Training and Education
- Use "Low" experience level for entry-level position examples
- Generate CVs for roles students are interested in
- Compare different locations to show global job market differences
- Use as examples for resume writing workshops
