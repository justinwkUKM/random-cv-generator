### Troubleshooting Common Usage Issues

#### API Rate Limits
**Problem**: "Rate limit exceeded" error
**Solution**: 
- Reduce batch size (try 10-15 CVs instead of 50)
- Wait 1-2 minutes between large batches
- Switch to Groq API if using OpenAI (often has higher limits)

#### Empty or Incomplete CVs
**Problem**: Generated CVs are too short or missing sections
**Solution**:
- Try different experience levels (High often generates more content)
- Switch between Groq and OpenAI versions
- Regenerate the batch (AI output can vary)

#### Download Issues
**Problem**: ZIP file won't download or is corrupted
**Solution**:
- Ensure all CVs finished generating before downloading
- Try refreshing the page and regenerating
- Check browser download settings and permissions

### Best Practices for Different Use Cases

#### HR and Recruitment
- Use realistic locations for your target market
- Generate 15-25 CVs per role for good variety
- Mix experience levels to see different candidate profiles
- Test with roles similar to your actual openings

#### System Testing and Development
- Start with small batches (5-10 CVs) for initial testing
- Use "Random" experience level for diverse test data
- Generate CVs for multiple roles to test system compatibility
- Verify PDF parsing and data extraction with generated files

#### Training and Education
- Use "Low" experience level for entry-level position examples
- Generate CVs for roles students are interested in

## üîß Technical Details

### PDF Generation Process Using FPDF Library

The application leverages the FPDF library to create professional, standardized PDF documents with consistent formatting and international character support.

#### Core PDF Architecture
```python
# PDF initialization and configuration
pdf = FPDF()
pdf.set_auto_page_break(auto=True, margin=15)
pdf.add_page()
```

#### Advanced Formatting Features

**Header and Title Styling:**
- **Primary Title**: 16pt Helvetica Bold, centered alignment
- **Color Scheme**: Blue headers (RGB: 0, 102, 204) for visual hierarchy
- **Decorative Elements**: Horizontal line separators with matching blue color
- **Positioning**: Precise coordinate-based layout for consistent appearance

**Section Management:**
- **Dynamic Section Detection**: Automatically identifies section headers ending with ":"
- **Font Switching**: Bold 12pt for headers, regular 12pt for content
- **Color Transitions**: Dark blue (RGB: 0, 51, 102) for section headers, black for content
- **Spacing Control**: Consistent line spacing (10pt) and section breaks (2pt)

**Multi-Cell Content Handling:**
```python
# Automatic text wrapping and page breaks
pdf.multi_cell(0, 10, content_text)
pdf.ln(2)  # Consistent spacing between elements
```

#### Character Encoding and International Support

**Primary Encoding Strategy:**
- **ASCII Filtering**: Converts non-ASCII characters to underscores for compatibility
- **Character Validation**: `ord(char) < 128` check for each character
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Secondary PDF generation with stricter character filtering

**International Name Handling:**
```python
# Character encoding safety
safe_text = ''.join(char if ord(char) < 128 else '_' for char in text)
```

**Error Recovery Process:**
1. **Primary Generation**: Attempt with standard character filtering
2. **Fallback Generation**: Strip all non-printable and non-ASCII characters
3. **Minimal PDF**: Create basic structure if all else fails

#### Page Management and Layout
- **Auto Page Breaks**: Automatic overflow handling with 15pt margins
- **Content Flow**: Seamless continuation across multiple pages
- **Margin Control**: Consistent 15pt margins on all sides
- **Font Compatibility**: Helvetica font family for cross-platform consistency

### Random Data Generation Using Faker Library

The application uses Python's Faker library to generate realistic, contextually appropriate personal and professional information.

#### Faker Configuration and Localization
```python
from faker import Faker
fake = Faker()  # Default locale with international support
```

#### Personal Information Generation

**Name Generation:**
- **Localized Names**: Context-aware name generation based on specified location
- **Gender Diversity**: Automatic male/female name selection
- **Cultural Appropriateness**: Names that fit the geographic region
- **Character Safety**: English character limitation for PDF compatibility

**Email Address Creation:**
```python
# Unique email generation algorithm
name_base = name.replace(' ', '.').lower()
random_hash = str(random.randint(1000, 9999))
email = f"{name_base}{random_hash}@example.com"
```
- **Uniqueness Guarantee**: 4-digit random hash prevents duplicates
- **Professional Format**: firstname.lastname + hash structure
- **Domain Standardization**: @example.com for consistency

**Phone Number Generation:**
- **Location-Aware Formatting**: Phone numbers appropriate to specified country/region
- **Format Variety**: Different phone number patterns based on locale
- **Realistic Patterns**: Follows actual phone numbering conventions
- **International Compatibility**: Supports various country codes and formats

#### Professional Data Context

**Experience Level Mapping:**

Total Archive Size: 500 KB - 5 MB (depending on batch size)
```

#### Character Encoding Handling for International Names

**Multi-Layer Encoding Strategy:**

**Level 1 - Standard Filtering:**
```python
safe_text = ''.join(char if ord(char) < 128 else '_' for char in text)
```
- **ASCII Limitation**: Restricts to ASCII character set (0-127)
- **Replacement Strategy**: Non-ASCII characters become underscores
- **Compatibility Focus**: Ensures PDF readability across all systems

**Level 2 - Enhanced Filtering:**
```python
safe_text = ''.join(c for c in text if ord(c) < 128 and c.isprintable())
```
- **Printable Characters Only**: Removes control characters and non-printable ASCII
- **Double Validation**: Both ASCII and printability checks
- **Fallback Activation**: Used when primary generation fails

**International Location Support:**

**Location-Specific Adaptations:**
- **Name Localization**: Faker generates culturally appropriate names
- **Phone Format Adaptation**: Country-specific phone number patterns
- **Address Formatting**: Regional address structure compliance
- **Language Considerations**: Skills and experience terms adapted to region

**Character Set Limitations:**
- **PDF Compatibility**: FPDF library ASCII limitations addressed
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensures PDFs open correctly on all systems
- **Font Embedding**: Helvetica font ensures consistent rendering
- **Encoding Transparency**: Users see actual characters that will appear in PDF

#### File Size and Performance Characteristics

**Individual PDF Specifications:**
- **File Size Range**: 50-150 KB per CV (varies by content length)
- **Page Count**: Typically 1-2 pages per CV
- **Resolution**: Standard PDF resolution (72 DPI)
- **Compression**: FPDF default compression for optimal file size

**Batch Processing Performance:**
- **Generation Speed**: 2-5 seconds per CV (Groq) / 10-30 seconds batch (OpenAI)
- **Memory Usage**: In-memory processing with automatic cleanup
- **Concurrent Handling**: Sequential processing prevents API rate limiting
- **Error Isolation**: Individual CV failures don't affect batch completion
